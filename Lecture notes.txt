To start the app

Run emulator with the minimum apps running on Mac, cant manage the volume.
In VScode
1. in one terminal window 
cd ~/Library/Android/sdk/emulator 
./emulator -avd Pixel_8_API_34 to run emulator 

2. in the second terminal window
echo $PATH
Verify that /Users/julia/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools and /Users/julia/Library/Android/sdk/emulator are listed in the output.

3. echo $ANDROID_HOME
It should now output /Users/julia/Library/Android/sdk.
cd $ANDROID_HOME 
ls

zsh to get to the correct repository
4. npx react-native start
5. npx react-native run-android

nano ~/.zshrc to open file with all the paths
source ~/.zshrc to save the changes
npx react-native doctor to run diagnostics

What we want the paths to be:
export ANDROID_HOME=/Users/julia/Library/Android/sdk  (on 1TBDrive at the moment)
export JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/zulu-17.jdk/Contents/Home
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/emulator

Lecture 2
React Native Components
Looked at the examples from https://reactnative.dev/docs/components-and-apis
everything we used is on the website

Lecture 3
https://github.com/react-native-linear-gradient/react-native-linear-gradient
https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-svg?tab=readme-ov-file

Lecture 4
https://reactnavigation.org/docs/getting-started
inside cd reactnative npm install @react-navigation/native
npm install react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context

react-native-screens package requires one additional configuration step to properly work on Android devices. 
Edit MainActivity.kt or MainActivity.java file which is located under 
android/app/src/main/java/<your package name>/.
Add the highlighted code to the body of MainActivity class:
Kotlin
class MainActivity: ReactActivity() {
  // ...
  override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
    super.onCreate(null)
  }
  // ...
}
import android.os.Bundle; in the same kt document

Then additionally we install 
https://reactnavigation.org/docs/bottom-tab-navigator
npm install @react-navigation/bottom-tabs 
for separate parts of the library, so that we do not 
install the whole library at once when we don't need to
